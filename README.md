# Source Engine Model Junk File Remover

A Simple VBScript that will make modelers lifes much easier in the Source Engine space, especially when it comes to GMod since recently, GMod now requires addons to remove `sw.vtx` files, since `sw.vtx` files are the same as `dx80.vtx` and `dx90.vtx`. If you have a few models, then that wouldn't be a big deal, but if you had lots of models, like props, NPC models, Playermodels, then it's more of a chore to select the files and delete them, well no more.

This will search `dx80.vtx` and `sw.vtx` files and you can choose to move the `dx80.vtx` files, `sw.vtx` files, or both into the Recycling Bin.

# How to Use?
To use the script, place the VBS script into and directory (where your models are located) that you want to move the junk files into the Recycling Bin. It will not move everything, as you need to go into each directory and repeat the steps.

This is my first time messing with VBScripts, so I tend to make sure that no severe mistakes are made, if you're cautious *I do not blame you*, you can make a backup of your model directory before you attempt to clear, it should at least tell you the files that it finds.
